        <h1>Target Audience</h1>
        <p>NGWeather hopes to reach a massive audience. However, the main consumer of the site will consist of primarily of those who enjoy the outdoors. The more
            time one spends outside, the more often they will be inclined to know what the day's conditions will be like. However, it is more than likely that the 
            site will serve those who are just commuting to work trying to decide whether to wear a jacket or not. This puts in scope the massive audience this site can 
            cater too.

                Isabella is an avid RC airplane enthusiast. She loves her hobby so much, she decides to plan a campus wide RC fly day, where all BYU-I students can come 
                fly their RC and have fun with friends. However, she wants to plan the event on a calm day with little wind and sunny skies. If not, someone might crash their
                aircraft! She understands the importance of good weather information, so she goes to NGWeather to make her decision.
