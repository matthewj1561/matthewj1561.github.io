                Visual Hierarchy

            <p>
                When considering visual hierarchy, we must consider what the user's eye is being drawn to. In Workstack's case, they remove
                all distractions and make the user focus solely on the free trial that is available. Alternatively, the user can view a video 
                that will advertise the product in a positively light. This makes the user experience simple and convenient, which is the goal 
                of all web developers.

            Rule of Thirds

            <h3><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/" target="blank">(Samsung)</a></h3>
            <img id="samsung-img" src="../images/samsung.PNG" alt="Mobile screenshot of the site Samsung">
            <p>
                The Rule of Thirds is simple. It states that pictures and graphics are most interesting when the subject of the frame is placed along 
                the lines that split the frame into thirds both horizontal and vertically. In Samsung's site, the first page has a 4 picture carousel, 
                three of them having the picture in the bottom right corner of the picture like in the image above. This shows that Samsung clearly 
                likes to utilize the Rule of Thirds.

            <p>
                Proper spacing and clean design is essential for a proper user experience. Overwhelming the user with too much information can make
                a site seem cluttered and unprofessional. Dell knows this, and thus makes their site extremely easy to comprehend and understand. The necessary 
                information is included in the front page, and an appropriate amount of blank space is present.
